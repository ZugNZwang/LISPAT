# _LISPAT_ - Lost in Space and Time

## _When Plagiarism is a Good Thing_

_Sr. Design Project â€“ Medtronic_

**LISPAT** _(Lost in Space and Time)_ is built to convert documents from their common pdf/docx format to txt, allowing for the use of Natural Language Processing on the provided data, with the goal of finding _semantic similarities_ between two documents. Using methods such as text cleaning, top keyword counts, top ngram counts, and leveraging python libraries to get the most out of the data. It extracts the most valuable information from each document all in order to capture the original information, in a manner that preserves and increases its value, accessibility and usefulness.

**_IMPORTANT:_** Please note due to limited resources for our application hosting large files will be difficult to process. We highly encourage the use of our samples provided.

Some notes about LISPAT.

1. To clear a search, click "enter", once you have removed your search words.
   - Search words are case sensitive.
2. Selected keywords will contain any word that has the same character occurrences of the keyword.
   For example: the word `words` is contained within `keywords`. So keywords will show up in the term search.
   If you want to contain the whole word, please the search bar.
