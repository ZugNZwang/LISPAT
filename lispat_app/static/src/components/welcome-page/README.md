**LISPAT** _(Lost in Space and Time)_ is built to convert documents from their common pdf/docx format to txt, allowing for the use of Natural Language Processing on the provided data, with the goal of finding _semantic similarities_ between two documents. Using methods such as text cleaning, top keyword counts, top ngram counts, and leveraging python libraries to get the most out of the data. It extracts the most valuable information from each document all in order to capture the original information, in a manner that preserves and increases its value, accessibility and usefulness.
