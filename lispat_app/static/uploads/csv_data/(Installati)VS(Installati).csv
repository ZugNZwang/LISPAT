1st Document,(Installati),"           Instructions                       Introduction  LISPAT is built to convert documents from their common pdf/docx/doc format to text. It can process the document’s information, perform similarity checks, and build a learning model for text classification and prediction all in order to capture the original information, in a manner that preserves and increases its value, accessibility, and usefulness.   To run LISPAT, we need to use python packing tools and node packages to download all the dependencies to your local machine. This approach is dependent on the python packaging tool pip and the nodejs packaging tool npm. A couple issues can arise with this approach, as it's not suggested, for the typical user. Some packages might require missing dependencies that our development environment is not aware of. As well as OS systems can contain different compilers which are also a potential issue to be aware of. There are supplied information on how to follow through with the build and run LISPAT. The best possible way is to create a virtual python environment and use this environment to download dependencies so they can be easily be deleted.  LISPAT was developed on Mac OSX Mojave, if there are any issues with installations, requirements or compiling errors, people need to contact our emails on how to troubleshoot if this is the case. Note due to character formatting on Windows there may be errors that will cause the application to not work properly. Docker was involved with the runtime of the program to prevent any compatibility issues, this is will provide the user with a simple and easier install, the user will just need to install Docker in order to follow these steps.                        Build from Source  There are a few necessary software installs needed in order to run the application:  - Git - Python3 - Pip3 - Nodejs - Npm   *The following was tested on the Ubuntu 18.04.02 Operating System   Open a terminal/command line and enter these commands with sudo rights:  Ø sudo apt-get install git Ø sudo apt-get install python3.6 Ø sudo apt-get install python3-pip Ø sudo apt-get nodejs Ø sudo apt-get npm Ø git clone https://github.com/brummetj/LISPAT.git Ø cd LISPAT Ø pip3 install -r requirements.txt Ø cd lispat_app/static Ø npm install Ø npm run build Ø cd ../..
