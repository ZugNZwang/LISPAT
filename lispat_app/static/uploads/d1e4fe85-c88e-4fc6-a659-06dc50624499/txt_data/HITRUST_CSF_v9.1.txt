Page   32   of  668         Level CIS Implementation Requirements Level CIS Implementation: Remote access to privileged functions, e.g., server, workstation and network device administration, is performed over secure channels. Protocols such as telnet and others that do not actively support strong encryption are only used when performed over a secondary encryption channel, e.g., SSL, TLS or IPSEC (see 09.s). Access to all hypervisor management functions or administrative consoles for systems hosting virtualized systems shall be restricted to personnel based upon the principle of least privilege and supported through technical controls (e.g., two-factor authentication, audit trails, IP address filtering, firewalls, and TLS encapsulated communications to the administrative consoles). The organization uses automated tools to inventory all administrative accounts and validates that each person with administrative privileges on desktops, laptops, and servers is authorized by a senior executive. Administrators should be required to access a system using a fully logged and non-administrative account. Then, once logged on to the machine without administrative privileges, the administrator should transition to administrative privileges using tools such as Sudo on Linux/UNIX, RunAs on Windows, and other similar facilities for other types of systems. Administrators shall use a dedicated machine for all administrative tasks or tasks requiring elevated access. This machine shall be isolated from the organization's primary network and not be allowed Internet access. This machine shall not be used for reading email, composing documents, or surfing the Internet. Contractors shall be provided with minimal system and physical access, and shall agree to and support the organization's security requirements. The contractor selection process shall assess the contractor's ability to adhere to and support the organization's security policy and procedures. Level CMS Implementation Requirements Level CMS Implementation: All system and removable media boot access shall be disabled unless it is explicitly authorized by the organizational CIO for compelling operational needs. If system and removable media boot access is authorized, boot access is password protected. The organization authorizes network access to privileged commands only for defined, compelling operational needs (defined in the applicable security plan) and documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system.

Level FTI Custodians Implementation Requirements Level FTI Custodians Implementation: Business roles and rules shall be imbedded at either the authentication level or application level. In either case, the agency must ensure that only authorized employees or contractors (as allowed by statute) of the agency receiving the information have access to FTI. The agency must restrict the sharing/re-disclosure of FTI to only those authorized in IRC 6103 and as approved by the Office of Safeguards. The organization shall password-protect system initialization (boot) settings. The agency must restrict the use of information system media (e.g., diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, CDs, DVDs) on information systems that receive, process, store, or transmit FTI using physical or automated controls. Multifunction Device (MFD) access enforcement controls must be configured correctly, including access controls for file shares, administrator and non-administrator privileges, and document retention functions. To use FTI in a SAN environment, the agency must ensure:  1. access controls are implemented and strictly enforced for all SAN components to limit access to disks containing FTI to authorized users; and 2. fibre channel devices must be configured to authenticate i. other devices with which they communicate in the SAN and  ii. administrator connections. The least privilege principle must be strictly enforced in a virtualized environment. To use a virtual environment that receives, processes, stores, or transmits FTI, programs that control the hypervisor should be secured and restricted to authorized administrators only.

In addition, segregation of networks shall be based on the value and classification of information stored or processed in the network, levels of trust, or lines of business, in order to reduce the total impact of a service disruption.  Networks shall be divided into separate logical network domains (e.g., an organization's internal network domains and external network domains) each protected by a defined security perimeter. A graduated set of controls shall be applied in different logical network domains to further segregate the network security environments (e.g., publicly accessible systems; internal networks; critical assets; and key information security tools, mechanisms, and support components associated with system and security administration).  Segregations of separate logical domains shall be achieved by restricting network access using virtual private networks for user groups within the organization. Networks shall also be segregated using network device functionality (e.g., IP switching). A baseline of network operations and expected data flows for users and systems shall be established and managed. Separate domains shall then be implanted by controlling the network data flows using routing/switching capabilities, including access control lists, according to applicable flow control policies. The domains shall be defined based on a risk assessment and the different security requirements within each of the domains.  The organization shall implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are logically separated from internal organizational networks. To ensure proper separation, the organization verifies any server that is visible from the Internet or an untrusted network and, if it is not required for business purposes, moves it to an internal VLAN and gives it a private address. Organizations shall use a network segregated from production-level networks when migrating physical servers, applications or data to virtualized servers.

Help desk support shall require user identification for any transaction that has information security implications. During the registration process to provide new or replacement hardware tokens, in-person verification shall be required in front of a designated registration authority with authorization by a designated organizational official (e.g., a supervisor). The information system, for hardware token-based authentication, employs mechanisms that satisfy minimum token requirements discussed in NIST SP 800-63-2, Electronic Authentication Guideline. When PKI-based authentication is used, the information system: validates certificates by constructing a certification path with status information to an accepted trust anchor;  1. validates certificates by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust anchor including checking certificate status information; 2. enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key; 3. maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and 4. implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation in case of an inability to access revocation information via the network. The information system shall use replay-resistant authentication mechanisms such as nonce, one-time passwords, or time stamps (e.g., Kerberos, TLS, etc.) for network access to privileged accounts.  The organization requires that access for all accounts, including those for network and security devices, is to be obtained through a centralized point of authentication, for example Active Directory or LDAP.  Electronic signatures based upon biometrics are designed to ensure that they cannot be used by any individual other than their genuine owners. Electronic signatures and handwritten signatures executed to electronic records shall be linked to their respective electronic records to ensure that the signatures cannot be excised, copied, or otherwise transferred to falsify an electronic record by ordinary means.        Copyright 2018 © HITRUST.

The agency should conduct and fully document periodic inspections of alternative work sites during the year to ensure that safeguards are adequate.  The agency must retain ownership and control, for all hardware, software, and end-point equipment connecting to public communication networks, where these are resident at all alternate work sites. Employees must have a specific room or area in a room that has the appropriate space and facilities for the type of work done. The agency must give employees locking file cabinets or desk drawers so that documents, disks, and tax returns may be properly secured when not in use. If agency furniture is not furnished to the employee, the agency must ensure that an adequate means of storage exists at the work site.  The agency must provide " locking hardware" to secure automated data processing equipment to large objects, such as desks or tables. Smaller, agency-owned equipment must be locked in a filing cabinet or desk drawer when not in use. FTI may be stored on hard disks only if agency-approved security access control devices (hardware/software) have been installed; are receiving regularly scheduled maintenance, including upgrades; and are being used. Access control must include password security, an audit trail, encryption, virus detection, and data overwriting capabilities. Computers and electronic media that receive, process, store, or transmit FTI must be in a secure area with restricted access. In situations when requirements of a secure area with restricted access cannot be maintained, such as home work sites, remote terminals or other office work sites, the equipment must receive the highest level of protection practical, including full disk encryption. All computers and mobile devices that contain FTI and are resident in an alternate work site must employ encryption mechanisms to ensure that this data may not be accessed, if the computer is lost or stolen.         Copyright 2018 © HITRUST.

Risk assessments shall be consistent and identify information security risks to the organization. The organization shall account for risks from sources including prior incidents experienced, changes in the environment (e.g., new methods of attack, new sources of attack, new vulnerabilities), and any supervisory guidance (e.g., third-party consultancy). They may be quantitative, semi- or quasi-quantitative, or qualitative but shall be consistent and comparable, so the prioritization of resources to manage risk can be performed. Risk assessments are to be performed at planned intervals, or when major changes occur in the environment, and the results reviewed annually.  Risk assessments (analyses), which are used to determine if a breach of unsecured protected health information (PHI) is reportable to Secretary of Health and Human Services, must demonstrate there is a low probability of compromise (lo pro co) rather than a significant risk of harm. The terms breach and PHI are as defined by the Secretary. The methodology shall, at a minimum, address the following factors:  1. the nature of the PHI involved, including the types of identifiers involved and the likelihood of re-identification; 2. the unauthorized person who used the PHI or to whom the disclosure was made; 3. whether the PHI was actually acquired or viewed; 4. the extent to which the risk to the PHI has been mitigated; and 5. and other factors/guidance promulgated by the Secretary.

A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks. Where necessary, the controller carries out a review to assess if processing is performed in accordance with the data impact assessment, at least when there is a change in the risk represented by processing operations. A data protection impact assessment is required in the case of: 1. a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions; 2. are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person; 3. processing on a large scale of special categories of personal data, or of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences; or 4. a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale. The controller seeks the advice of the data protection officer, where designated, when carrying out a data protection impact assessment and, where appropriate, seeks out the views of data subjects or their representatives on the intended processing, without prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations. Data protection impact assessments contain at least: 1. a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller; 2. an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes; 3. an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1; and 4. the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with the EU GDPR taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned. The controller consults the supervisory authority prior to processing where a data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk. When consulting the supervisory authority, the controller provides the supervisory authority with: 1. where applicable, the respective responsibilities of the controller, joint controllers and processors involved in the processing, in particular for processing within a group of undertakings; 2. the purposes and means of the intended processing;  3. the measures and safeguards provided to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects pursuant to the EU GDPR;        Copyright 2018 © HITRUST.

Level HIX Implementation Requirements Level HIX Implementation: The organization shall  1. Develop a documented security and privacy assessment plan that describes the scope of the assessment, including security and privacy controls and control enhancements under the assessment, assessment procedures to be used to determine control effectiveness, and the assessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and responsibilities;  2. Assess the security and privacy controls in the information system within every three-hundred-sixty-five (365) days in accordance with the current Catalog of Minimum Acceptable Risk Security and Privacy Controls for Exchanges to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the established security and privacy requirements; 3. Produce an assessment report that documents the result of the assessment; and  4. Provide the results of the security and privacy control assessment within every three hundred sixty-five (365) days, in writing, to the Business Owner who is responsible for reviewing the assessment documentation and update system security documentation where necessary to reflect any changes to the system.  A security and privacy assessment of all security and privacy controls must be conducted prior to issuing the authority to operate for all newly implemented, or significantly changed systems. The annual security assessment requirement mandated by CMS requires all Minimum Security Controls attributable to a system or application to be assessed over a three (3) year period. To meet this requirement, a subset of the Minimum Acceptable Risk Controls for Exchanges shall be tested each year so that all security controls are tested during a three (3) year period.  The Business Owner notifies the CMS within thirty (30) days whenever updates are made to system security and privacy authorization artifacts or when significant role changes occur (e.g., Business Owner, System Developer/Maintainer, ISSO). An independent assessment of all security and privacy controls is conducted every three (3) years or with each major system change.

Avoidance - This approach eliminates the risk by avoidance of the activity which provides the risk. For example, the risk associated with utilization of wireless technologies can be mitigated by deciding not to use wireless technologies at all.  2. Reduction - Risk can be reduced by way of controls that can reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk. An example would be encryption of network traffic to minimize risks that threaten the confidentiality of data.  3. Transference - Risk can be reduced by shifting it to an outside entity. An example would be the purchase of insurance against fire damage.  4. Acceptance - Organizations can choose to accept risk by not selecting any of the aforementioned approaches. When acceptance is selected, management acceptance must be documented.  Organizations shall define and document the criteria to determine whether or not a risk shall be avoided, accepted, transferred or treated.  The factors to be taken into account shall include the following:  1. industry sector, industry or organizational laws, regulations and standards;  2. clinical or other priorities (in the case of health-related organizations);  3. cultural fit;  4. patient reactions (in the case of health-related organizations);  5. coherence with IT, corporate risk acceptance, and clinical strategy (in the case of health organizations);  6. cost;        Copyright 2018 © HITRUST.

The reviews should result in actions to address service-level conflicts or inconsistencies resulting from disparate supplier relationships. Third-party service providers shall demonstrate compliance with information security and confidentiality, access control, service definitions, and delivery-level agreements included in third-party contracts. Third-party reports, records, and services shall undergo audit and review at least annually to govern and maintain compliance with the service delivery agreements. Level FTI Custodians Implementation Requirements Level FTI Custodians Implementation: Organizations shall ensure acquisition contracts contain appropriate language from IRS Pub 1075 v2014 Exhibit 7, Safeguarding Contract Language. Organizations must establish security policies and procedures based on IRS Publication 1075 for how FTI is stored, handled, and accessed inside the cloud through a legally binding contract or Service Level Agreement (SLA) with its third-party Cloud provider. Additional SLA requirements include but are not limited to:  1. FTI must be encrypted in transit within the cloud environment. All mechanisms used to encrypt FTI must be FIPS 140-2 compliant, and operate using the FIPS 140-2 compliant module.  2. FTI may need to be encrypted while at rest in the Cloud, depending upon the security protocols inherent in the cCoud. If the cloud environment cannot appropriately isolate FTI, encryption is a potential compensating control. All mechanisms used to encrypt FTI must be FIPS 140-2 compliant and operate using the FIPS 140-2 compliant module.  3. Storage devices where FTI has resided must be securely sanitized or destroyed using methods acceptable by NSA and Central Security Service (CSS). Organization-defined security controls for third-party arrangements (e.g., in cloud service providers) must be identified, documented (e.g., in a legally-binding contract or SLA), and implemented. The defined security controls, as implemented, must comply with the requirements specified in IRS Pub 1075       Copyright 2018 © HITRUST.

Level GDPR Implementation Requirements Level GDPR Implementation: Where two or more data controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they shall be joint controllers. They shall in a transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities for compliance with the obligations under GDPR, in particular as regards the exercising of the rights of the data subject and their respective duties to provide information regarding access to personal data, whether obtained by the controller from the subject or from another source, by means of an arrangement between them unless, and in so far as, the respective responsibilities of the controllers are determined by EU or Member State law to which the controllers are subject. This arrangement shall duly reflect the respective roles and relationships of the joint controllers vis-à-vis the data subjects, and the essence of the arrangement shall be made available to the data subject. The data controllers involved in the arrangement specifically allows a data subject to exercise the subjects rights under the GDPR in respect of and against each of the controllers. The processor shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorization of the controller. In the case of general written authorization, the processor shall inform the controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the controller the opportunity to object to such changes. Processing by a processor shall be governed by a written contract or other legal act (instrument) under Union or Member State law, including one in electronic form, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. That contract or other legal act (instrument) shall stipulate that the processor: 1. processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest; 2. ensures that persons authorized to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality; 3. takes all measures required pursuant by the EU GDPR for the security of processing personal data; 4. respects the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 for engaging another processor; 5. taking into account the nature of the processing, assists the controller by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the controller's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III; 6. assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations for the       Copyright 2018 © HITRUST.

The processor requires the same data protection obligations in a written contract or other legal act (instrument) under EU or Member State law, including one in electronic form, where it engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, and in particular provides sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of the EU GDPR. The data controller ensures a processor and any person acting under the authority of the controller or of the processor, who has access to personal data, does not process those data except on instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law. The controller and processor take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law.

To help determine if a business or technical process is leaving behind or otherwise leaking sensitive information (e.g., personally identifiable information, health, credit card, or classified information), the organization conducts periodic scans of server machines using automated tools to determine whether sensitive data is present on the system in clear text. Utilize file integrity checking tools to ensure that critical system files (including sensitive system and application executables, libraries, and configurations) have not been altered.  The file integrity checking tools reporting system should:  1. have the ability to account for routine and expected changes 2. highlight and alert on unusual or unexpected changes; 3. show the history of configuration changes over time and identify who made the change (including the original logged-in account in the event of a user ID switch, such as with the su or sudo command).  4. owner and permissions changes to files or directories;  5. the use of alternate data streams which could be used to hide malicious activities; 6. and the introduction of extra files into key system areas (which could indicate malicious payloads left by attackers or additional files inappropriately added during batch distribution processes).

The perimeter is enclosed by slab-to-slab walls constructed of durable materials and supplemented by periodic inspection. Any lesser-type partition must be supplemented by electronic intrusion detection and fire detection systems. All doors entering the space must be locked in accordance with Locking Systems for Secured Areas. In the case of a fence/gate, the fence must have intrusion detection devices or be continually guarded, and the gate must be either guarded or locked with intrusion alarms. A security room is a room that has been constructed to resist forced entry. The entire room must be enclosed by slab-to-slab walls constructed of approved materials (e.g., masonry brick, concrete) and supplemented by periodic inspection, and entrance must be limited to specifically authorized personnel. Door hinge pins must be non-removable or installed on the inside of the room. FTI must be containerized in areas where no persons, other than authorized employees or authorized contractors, may have access afterhours.  A security guard, custodial services worker or landlord may have access to a locked building or a locked room if FTI is in a locked container. If FTI is in a locked room, but not in a locked container, the guard, janitor or landlord may have a key to the building but not to the room.  During business hours, if authorized personnel serve as the second barrier between FTI and unauthorized individuals, the authorized personnel must wear an identification badge or credential clearly displayed, preferably worn above the waist.

Periodic reviews/scans shall be required of installed software and the data content of systems to identify and, where possible, remove any unauthorized software. However, server environments for which the server software developer specifically recommends not installing host-based anti-virus and anti-spyware software, may address the requirement via a network-based malware detection (NBMD) solution. If an NBMD solution is used, the organization shall also:  1. disable USB ports, 2. prohibit the use of writable media (e.g., DVD-R), 3. restrict the use of read-only media (e.g., DVD-ROM) to legitimate commercial sources for legitimate business reasons (e.g., Linux installation disks), and 4. allow only whitelisted software to run on the system. The NBMD solution must be installed in-band, whether or not blocking is enabled. Cloud-based implementations with blocking enabled is preferred. If the organization chooses to implement a local solution and/or disables blocking, the decision must be supported by a formal risk analysis, and any additional risk formally accepted by management as required by its risk management policy.  The organization employs anti-malware software that offers a centralized infrastructure that compiles information on file reputations or has administrators manually push updates to all machines. After applying an update, automated systems verify that each system has received its signature update. Procedures shall be defined for response to identification of malicious code or unauthorized software. Checking anti-virus or anti-spy software shall generate audit logs of checks performed. The checks carried out by the malicious code detection and repair software to scan computers and media shall include:  1. checking any files on electronic or optical media, and files received over networks, for malicious code before use;  2. checking electronic mail attachments and downloads for malicious code or file types that are unnecessary for the organization's business before use; this check shall be carried out at different places (e.g., at electronic mail servers, desk top computers and when entering the network of the organization); and 3. checking Web traffic, such as HTML, JavaScript, and HTTP, for malicious code; and 4. checking removable media (e.g., USB tokens and hard drives, CDs/DVDs, FireWire devices, and external serial advanced technology attachment devices) when inserted. Formal policies shall be required prohibiting the use or installation of unauthorized software, including a prohibition of obtaining data and software from external networks.

The agency shall identify and analyze how FTI in a data warehouse is used and how FTI is queried or targeted by end users. Parts of the system containing FTI shall be mapped to follow the flow of the query from a client through the authentication server to the release of the query from the database server. To use a VoIP network that provides FTI to a customer, VoIP phones must be logically protected. FTI must be encrypted while in transit within a SAN environment. SAN management traffic must also be encrypted for SAN components. To use a virtual environment that receives, processes, stores, or transmits FTI, FTI data transmitted via hypervisor management communication systems on untrusted networks must be encrypted using FIPS-approved methods provided by either the virtualization solution or third-party solution, such as a VPN that encapsulates the management traffic. To use a VoIP network that provides FTI to a customer, the VoIP traffic must be encrypted using a NIST-approved method operating in a NIST-approved mode when FTI is in transit across the network (either Internet or state agency's network). To access FTI from a Web browser, the agency must encrypt FTI transmissions within the agencies internal network using a cryptographic module that is FIPS 140-2 validated.

If the media will be reused by the agency for the same purpose of storing FTI and will not be leaving organization control, then clearing is a sufficient method of sanitization. If the media will be reused and repurposed for a non-FTI function or will be leaving organization control (i.e., media being exchanged for warranty, cost rebate, or other purposes - and where the specific media will not be returned to the agency), then purging should be selected as the sanitization method. If the media will not be reused at all, then destroying is the method for media sanitization. The following media sanitization requirements are applicable for media used in "pre-production" or "test" environments:  1. The technique for clearing, purging, and destroying media depends on the type of media being sanitized. 2. A representative sampling of media must be tested after sanitization has been completed; and 3. Media sanitization should be witnessed or verified by an agency employee. Disposal of all Multifunction Device (MFD) hardware (e.g., hard disks) and WLAN components follows the organization's standard media sanitization and disposal procedure requirements. FTI furnished to the user and any paper material generated therefrom, such as extra copies, photo impressions, computer printouts, carbon paper, notes, stenographic notes, and work papers must be destroyed by burning, mulching, pulping, shredding, or disintegrating.  FTI must never be disclosed to an agency's agents or contractors during disposal, unless authorized by the Internal Revenue Code. Agencies must review and approve media to be sanitized to ensure compliance with records-retention policies. Tracking/documenting actions include, for example, listing personnel who reviewed and approved sanitization and disposal actions, types of media sanitized, specific files stored on the media, sanitization methods used, date and time of the sanitization actions, personnel who performed the sanitization, verification actions taken, personnel who performed the verification, and disposal action taken.

Page   484   of  668         PMI DSP Framework PR.DS-5 Level CIS Implementation Requirements Level CIS Implementation: The organization monitors the use and attempted use of removable media in the organization's information systems. The organization monitors all traffic leaving the organization (e.g., through the use of a proxy server as required in 01.o) to detect any unauthorized use of encryption, terminate the connection and take corrective action, (e.g., discipline the responsible party IAW 02.f, remediate the infected system). The organization treats enterprise access from VLANs with BYOD systems or other untrusted devices (e.g., legacy medical devices) as untrusted, and filters and audits this access accordingly. The organization profiles each user's typical account usage by determining normal time-of-day access and access duration, and generates reports that indicate users who have logged in during unusual hours or have exceeded their normal login duration, which includes flagging the use of the user's credentials from a computer other than computers on which the user generally works. Network boundary devices, including firewalls, network-based IPS, and inbound and outbound proxies, are configured to verbosely log all traffic (both allowed and blocked) arriving at the device, which at a minimum shall include the full packet header information and payload of the traffic destined for or passing through the network perimeter. The organization employs automated tools to continuously monitor workstations, servers, and mobile devices with anti-virus, anti-spyware, personal firewalls, and host-based IPS functionality. All malware detection events should be sent to enterprise anti-malware administration tools and event log servers. To help identify covert channels exfiltrating data through a firewall, the organization configures the built-in firewall session tracking mechanisms included in many commercial firewalls to identify TCP sessions that last an unusually long time for the given organization and firewall device, alerting personnel about the source and destination addresses associated with these long sessions. The organization uses network-based DLP solutions to monitor and control the flow of data within the network. Any anomalies that exceed the normal traffic patterns are noted and appropriate action is taken to address them. The network-based DLP solutions are also used to monitor for sensitive information (e.g., personally identifiable information), keywords, and other document characteristics to discover unauthorized attempts to exfiltrate data across network boundaries and block such transfers while alerting information security personnel. The organization uses host-based data loss prevention (DLP) to enforce ACLs even when data is copied off a server.  The organization controls and monitors any user or system accounts used to perform penetration testing to make sure they are only being used for legitimate purposes, and are removed or restored to normal function after testing is over.       Copyright 2018 © HITRUST.

Report findings from the review and analysis of information system audit records according to the agency incident response policy. If the finding involves a potential unauthorized disclosure of FTI, the appropriate special agent-in-charge, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), and the IRS Office of Safeguards must be contacted, as described in Section 10.0, Reporting Improper Inspections or Disclosures. Intrusion-detection software shall be installed and maintained to monitor networks for any unauthorized attempt to access tax data in a data warehouse. The organization must employ automated mechanisms to alert security personnel of inappropriate or unusual activities with security implications, and implement host-based monitoring mechanisms (e.g., Host intrusion prevention system (HIPS)) on information systems that receive, process, store, or transmit FTI. The information system must notify designated agency officials of detected suspicious events and take necessary actions to address suspicious events. The agency shall ensure that audit reports are created and reviewed for data warehousing-related access attempts. If a query is submitted, the audit log must identify the actual query made, the originator of the query, and relevant time and stamp information. A security administrator shall periodically collect and review audit logs from Multifunction Devices (MFDs) and print spoolers. The organization reviews the audit logs (trails) of SAN components on a regular basis to track access to FTI in the SAN environment. To use a virtual environment that receives, processes, stores, or transmits FTI, the agency must ensure virtualization providers must be able to monitor for threats and other activity that is occurring within the virtual environment - this includes being able to monitor the movement of FTI into and out of the virtual environment. To use a VoIP network that provides FTI to a customer, the agency must be able to track and audit all FTI-applicable conversations and access.       Copyright 2018 © HITRUST.

For all other OSs and applications, and to resolve configuration conflicts among multiple security guidelines, the CMS hierarchy for implementing security configuration guidelines is as follows:  •     USGCB •     NIST National Checklist Program (NCP); Tier IV, then Tier III, Tier II, and Tier I, in descending order. •     Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) STIGs •     National Security Agency (NSA) STIGs •     If formal government-authored checklists do not exist, then organizations are encouraged to use vendor or industry group (such as The Center for Internet Security [CIS]) checklists. •     In situations where no guidance exists, coordinate with CMS for guidance. CMS shall collaborate within CMS and the HHS Cybersecurity Program, and other OPDIVs through the HHS Continuous Monitoring and Risk Scoring (CMRS) working group to establish baselines and communicate industry and vendor best practices. •     All deviations from existing USGCB, NCP, DISA and/or NSA configurations must be documented in an approved HHS waiver, with copies submitted to the Department.  The organization shall maintain a baseline configuration for development and test environments that is managed separately from the operational baseline configuration.  The organization shall employ automated mechanisms to enforce access restrictions and support auditing of the enforcement actions. The organization reviews information system changes weekly, and when indications so warrant, to determine whether unauthorized changes have occurred.  The information system shall prevent the installation of network and server software and firmware components without verification that the component has been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization.

The organization shall analyze changes to the information system in a separate test environment before implementation in an operational environment, looking for security impacts due to flaws, weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional malice. The organization shall employ automated mechanisms to maintain up-to-date, complete, accurate, and readily available baseline configuration of the information system.  Level FedRAMP Implementation Requirements Level FedRAMP Implementation: The organization employs automated mechanisms to maintain up-to-date, complete, accurate, and readily available baseline configurations of the information system. The service provider establishes a central means of communicating major changes to or developments in the information system or environment of operations that may affect its services to the federal government and associated service consumers (e.g., electronic bulletin board, web status page). The means of communication are approved and accepted by the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and Authorizing Official (AO). The organization employs automated mechanisms to enforce access restrictions and support auditing of the enforcement actions.  The information system prevents the installation of network, server and firmware components without verification that the component has been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization. If digital signatures/certificates are unavailable, alternative cryptographic integrity checks (hashes, self-signed certs, etc.) can be utilized. The service provider uses the Center for Internet Security guidelines (Level 1) to establish configuration settings or establishes its own configuration settings if United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) is not available; and ensures that checklists for configuration settings are Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) validated or SCAP compatible (if validated checklists are not available). The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to enable integrity verification of software and firmware components.

Page   552   of  668         Regulatory Factors: Level 2 Implementation: Level 1 plus: The organization shall define and establish the roles and responsibilities associated with technical vulnerability management, including vulnerability monitoring, vulnerability risk assessment, patching, asset tracking, and any coordination responsibilities required. Information resources (including tools and vulnerability mailing lists/other information sources), that will be used to identify relevant technical vulnerabilities and to maintain awareness about them, shall be identified for software and other technology (based on the asset inventory list, see 7.a). These information resources shall be updated based on changes in the inventory, or when other new or useful resources are found. Internal and external vulnerability assessments of sensitive information systems (e.g., systems containing covered information, cardholder data) and networked environments shall be performed on a quarterly basis, and after any significant change in the network (e.g., new system component installations, changes in network topology, firewall rule modifications, product upgrades), by a qualified individual. These tests shall include both network- and application-layer tests. Security vulnerability assessment tools or services shall accommodate the virtualization technologies used by the organization (e.g., virtualization aware). The action taken shall be carried out according to the controls related to change management (see 10.k) or by following information security incident response procedures (see 11.c).  If a patch is available, change control procedures for the implementation of security patches and software modifications shall be followed (see 09.b). This shall include assessing the risks associated with installing the patch (i.e., the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the patch). Patches shall be tested and evaluated before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be tolerated.  If no patch is available, is delayed, or not applied, other controls shall be applied including:  •     documentation of impact; •     documented change approval by authorized parties; •     functionality testing to verify that the change does not adversely impact the security of the system; •     back-out procedures; •     turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability; •     adapting or adding access controls (e.g., firewalls) at network borders (see 9.m); •     increased monitoring to detect or prevent actual attacks; and •     raising awareness of the vulnerability. An audit log shall be kept for all procedures undertaken.       Copyright 2018 © HITRUST.

The risk ranking shall consider the CVSS score, classification of the vendor supplied patch, and/or the classification and criticality of the affected system. The technical vulnerability management process shall be evaluated on a quarterly basis in order to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency. Systems at high risk shall be addressed first. The configuration standards shall be required by CSF control 10.k for all system components (e.g., workstations, databases, servers, operating systems, applications, routers, switches, wireless access points). The standards shall be hardened to address, to the extent practical, all known security vulnerabilities. In particular, laptops, workstations, and servers are configured so they will not auto-run content from removable media (e.g., USB tokens, i.e., thumb drives; USB hard drives; CDs/DVDs; FireWire devices; external serial advanced technology attachment devices; and mounted network shares). The organization's configuration standards shall be consistent with industry-accepted system hardening standards, including:  •     Center for Internet Security (CIS)  •     International Organization for Standardization (ISO)  •     SysAdmin Audit Network Security (SANS)  •     National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST) Enable only necessary and secure services, protocols, daemons, etc., as required for the function of the system. Implement security features for any required services, protocols or daemons that are considered to be insecure (e.g., use secured technologies such as SSH, S-FTP, TLS 1.1 or later, or IPSec VPN to protect insecure services such as NetBIOS, file-sharing, Telnet, FTP, etc.).  The organization conducts both internal and external penetration testing, within every three hundred sixty-five (365) days, on defined information systems or system components. A prioritization process is implemented to determine which patches are applied across the organizations systems. Patches installed in the production environment are also installed in the organizations disaster recovery environment in a timely manner.

Patches are applied to all systems, even systems that are properly air gapped. The organization performs periodic Red Team exercises to test organizational readiness to identify and stop attacks or to respond quickly and effectively. The organization provides clear goals for penetration tests, e.g., to address blended attacks and identify potential goal machines or target assets. The organization's testing addresses APT-style attacks deploying multiple vectors, often social engineering combined with Web or network exploitation. The organization's Red Team manual or automated testing also captures pivoted and multi-vector attacks to provide a more realistic assessment of security posture and risk to critical assets. The organization uses vulnerability scanning and penetration testing tools in concert. The results of vulnerability scanning assessments should be used as a starting point to guide and focus penetration testing efforts. The organization ensures, wherever possible, that Red Team results are documented using open, machine-readable standards (e.g., SCAP) and devises a scoring method for determining the results of Red Team exercises, so that results can be compared over time. Create a test bed that mimics a production environment for specific penetration tests and Red Team attacks against elements that are not typically tested in production, such as attacks against supervisory control and data acquisition and other control systems. The organization ensures new vulnerabilities and threats are addressed when updating secure system (component) standards and images (see also 10.k). Vulnerability scanning is performed in authenticated mode either with local agents running on each endpoint to analyze the security configuration or with remote scanners that are given administrative rights on the system being tested. A dedicated account, which is tied to specific machines at specific IP addresses and not used for any other administrative activities, is used for authenticated vulnerability scans. Only authorized employees have access to vulnerability management tools and/or the management interface, and roles are applied to each user.

The organization uses automated patch management tools and software update tools for the operation system and/or software/applications on all information systems for which such tools are available and determined to be safe. The organization monitors logs associated with any scanning activity and associated administrator accounts to ensure this activity is limited to the timeframes of legitimate scans. The organization compares the results from back-to-back vulnerability scans to verify that vulnerabilities were addressed either by patching, implementing a compensating control, or documenting and accepting a reasonable business risk. Such acceptance of business risks for existing vulnerabilities are periodically reviewed to determine if newer compensating controls or subsequent patches can address vulnerabilities that were previously accepted, or if conditions have changed, increasing the risk. Level CMS Implementation Requirements Level CMS Implementation: The organization shall correct identified information system flaws on production equipment within ten (10) business days and all others within thirty (30) calendar days. A risk-based decision is documented through the configuration management process in the form of written authorization from the CMS CIO, or his/her designated representative (e.g., the system data owner or CMS CISO), if a security patch is not applied to a security-based system or network. For critical infrastructure and systems (e.g., public-facing, internet accessible), critical security patches shall be applied within one (1) month of release. For less-critical infrastructure and systems (e.g., only accessible internally) or for non-critical security patches, patches shall be applied within three (3) months of release.  The organization shall attempt to determine what information about the information system environment is discernible by adversaries and subsequently takes appropriate corrective action to limit discoverable system information. The organization shall centrally manage the flaw remediation process and shall install software updates, automatically where possible. Conduct an enterprise security posture review as needed but no less than once within every three-hundred-sixty-five (365) days, in accordance with organizational IS procedures.

To use an external Web-based system or Website that provides FTI over the Internet to a customer, the agency must ensure each system within the architecture that receives, processes, stores, or transmits FTI to an external customer through the Web-based system or Website is subject to frequent vulnerability testing  To access FTI using a Web browser, the agency must install vendor-specified security patches and hot fixes regularly for the Web browser, add-ons, and Java. To use FTI in an 802.11 WLAN, the agency must conduct vulnerability scanning as part of periodic technical security assessments for the organization's WLAN. Level HIX Implementation Requirements Level HIX Implementation: Perform external network penetration testing and conduct an enterprise security posture review as needed but no less than once within every three-hundred-sixty-five (365) days, in accordance with organizational information security procedures. The organization mitigates legitimate high-risk vulnerabilities within thirty (30) days and moderate risk vulnerabilities within ninety (90) days. The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the analysis as part of its authorization package (see also 09.i), and updates the report in any reauthorization action. The organization installs security-relevant software and firmware updates on production equipment within a timeframe based on the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Vulnerability Severity Rating of the flaw as follows: High severity within seven (7) calendar days, medium severity within fifteen (15) calendar days, and all others within thirty (30) calendar days. The organization incorporates flaw remediation into the organizational configuration management process, with risk-based decisions if a security patch is not applied to a security-based system or network authorized by the organization. Level PCI Implementation Requirements Level PCI Implementation: Perform quarterly internal vulnerability scans and rescans, which may be automated, manual, or a combination thereof, as needed, until all "high-risk" vulnerabilities are resolved in accordance with the organization's vulnerability rankings. Scans must be performed by qualified personnel. Perform quarterly external vulnerability scans, via an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) approved by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). Perform rescans as needed, until passing scans are achieved. Perform internal and external scans, and rescans as needed, after any significant       Copyright 2018 © HITRUST.

Implement a methodology for penetration testing that:  •     is based on industry-accepted penetration testing approaches (e.g., NIST SP 800-115); •     includes coverage for the entire card data environment (CDE) perimeter and critical systems; •     includes testing from both inside and outside the network; •     includes testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls; •     defines application-layer penetration tests to include, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities identified in 10.b, level 1 (reference PCI DSS v3 6.5); •     defines network-layer penetration tests to include components that support network functions as well as operating systems; •     includes review and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities experienced in the last 12 months; and  •     specifies retention of penetration testing results and remediation activities results. If segmentation is used to isolate the CDE from other networks, perform penetration tests at least annually and after any changes to segmentation controls/methods to verify that the segmentation methods are operational and effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from in the CDE. For organizations assessed as a service provider, penetration testing on segmentation controls are performed at least every six (6) months and after any changes to segmentation controls/methods.         Copyright 2018 © HITRUST.

Exceptions include, but are not limited to, treatment, requests by the individual, or uses or disclosures pursuant to a valid authorization, required by law, or required for compliance with other requirements, such as disclosures made to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. A covered entity must make reasonable efforts to limit the access of persons or classes of persons to those with a legitimate need to access PHI. The covered entity limits the PHI disclosed to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose of the disclosure. The covered entity only creates and uses information that is not individually identifiable (i.e., de-identified) when a code or other means of record identification designed to enable coded, or otherwise de-identified information to be re-identified, is not disclosed. If the de-identified information is subsequently re-identified, the covered entity only uses or discloses such re-identified information as permitted or required for PHI. The covered entity or business associate understands that health information is not identifiable (i.e., de-identified) only when there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual and meets federal requirements for de-identified data.

Communication between certified emergency medical services personnel or a physician providing medical supervision and a patient, and records relating to the identity, evaluation, or treatment of a patient that are made or created in the course of providing emergency medical services to the patient, shall be considered confidential and privileged and may not be disclosed except as provided by federal or state law. The covered entity must permit, and must accomodate reasonable requests by, individuals who represent they are in danger to request to receive communications of PHI from the covered entity by alternative means or at alternative locations. As appropriate, the covered entity only conditions requests for confidential communications on how payment, if any, will be handled and the specification of an alternative address or other method of contact; however, in no case may the organization require an explanation as to the basis of the individual's request.

Level Group Health Plans Implementation Requirements Level Group Health Plans Implementation: The group health plan documents appropriately restrict the use and disclosure of PHI by the plan sponsor. The group health plan, or a health insurance issuer or HMO with respect to the group plan, limits disclosures to the plan sponsor of information based on whether an individual is participating in the plan,or is enrolled in or disenrolled from a health insurance issuer or HMO offered by the plan. The group health plan documents are amended as required to incorporate provisions to establish permitted and required uses and disclosures, and disclose PHI to the plan sponsor only upon receipt of certification that the documents have been amended for specific, limited reasons, e.g., that no use or further disclosure other than that permitted or required will be made.  Plan documents ensure adequate separation between the group health plan and the plan sponsor by describing employees or classes of employees to whom PHI may be disclosed, restricting access and use by such persons or classes of persons to administrative functions the plan sponsor performs, and providing an effective mechanism for resolving issues of noncompliance with the plan document provisions.
