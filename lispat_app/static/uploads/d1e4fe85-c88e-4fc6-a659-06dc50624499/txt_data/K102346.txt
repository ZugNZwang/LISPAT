Test Principle: The Randox Digoxin immunoturbidimetric assay for the determination of digoxin in human serum and plasma consists of various in vitro diagnostic test reagents.  The immunoassay utilized in this test system is based upon the principle of measuring changes in scattered light.  When digoxin is present in the sample, it competes with a digoxin-latex complex for binding with the anti-digoxin antibody and inhibits the formation of the agglutination complex.  The rate of agglutination is inversely proportional to the sample concentration of digoxin.  By monitoring the change in scattered light (absorbance at 694 nm) caused by varying degrees of agglutination, a concentration curve is obtained and the amount of digoxin can be calculated. M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable): 1. Analytical performance: a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision was evaluated following guideline EP5-A2. Precision samples were comprised of drug-free human serum spiked with pure digoxin.  Two replicates of each sample were tested twice a day on 20 separate days, yielding 80 replicates total over 40 runs.  Each precision study was completed on 2 separate Advia 1650  4 instruments (numbers 505 and 786). Precision Results Advia 1650 System Number 505 Sample Units = ng/mL Mean  Digoxin Conc.

High spiked pool samples were diluted using low pool samples to give a total of 9 dilutions, ranging from 0.41 ng/mL to 5.79 ng/mL. The samples were measured in triplicate on a single Advia 1650 instrument using one lot of reagent.  Statistical evaluation gave the following results: Level Units = ng/mL % Recovery Expected Conc. Observed Conc. 1 0.41 0.41 100 2 1.09 1.05 96.7 3 1.76 1.89 107.3 4 2.43 2.43 99.9 5 3.10 2.98 96.1 6 3.77 3.46 91.6 7 4.45 4.01 90.2 8 5.12 4.75 92.9 9 5.79 5.79 100 Plasma Linearity Study: y = 0.94x + 0.060, R² = 0.9912 The reportable range of the assay is defined as the functional level of quantitation to the highest calibrator concentration.  The stated reportable range in the device package insert is 0.4 ng/mL to 5.0 ng/mL c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods): Traceability The Randox Digoxin method is traceable to an internal standard manufactured using highly purified material.  This internal standard is compared to USP material by comparison analysis using five equally spaced concentration intervals across the assay AMR, with triplicate analysis using only one lot of reagent.  The sponsor specifies that individual recovery for each internal standard must be within ± 10% of the USP material concentration. Value Assignment Calibrators (previously cleared in k012318) are derived from a calibrator master lot, which is prepared form the internal standards and compared to the USP material for  6 value verification.  Verification testing also uses both the calibrators being value assigned and previously assigned calibrators, and compares the values. Controls (previously cleared in k012319) are value assigned using the both the master calibrators and the current assay calibrators. The sponsor stated that calibrators and controls must have a % difference from the USP material of ≤ 5% difference (and any USP prepared dilutions must recover within 10% of their target concentration). Stability Calibrator and control stability was previously cleared in k012318 and k012319 respectively. Calibration Interval Stability across a 30 day calibration interval was assessed by calculating the percentage bias of the precision samples on each day from the result obtained for that precision samples from the calibration on the first day. The results support the product claim of a 7-day calibration interval. d. Detection limit: Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were determined following guideline EP17-A.  For LoB determination, 2 replicates of the low calibrator were performed in 2 runs per day over 20 operator days, using 2 analyzers and one reagent lot – giving 80 determinations in total.  For LoD determination, 2 replicates of a low sample were performed in 2 runs per day over 20 operator days, using 2 analyzers and one reagent lot – giving 80 determinations in total.  The low sample was made by spiking a drug-free human serum pool with pure digoxin. For LoQ determination, ten replicates of each of six serum pools were run with two instruments over five days using one reagent lot – giving 120 determinations in total for each serum pool.  The sponsor stated that the bias and standard deviation at the LoQ (0.4 ng/mL) was 0.00 and 0.44 respectively, and the total imprecision CV at 0.4 ng/mL was 11.0%.              Result Summary: Based on the study result, the following detection limit claims were made:                LoB LoD LoQ 0.01 ng/mL 0.04 ng/mL 0.4 ng/mL  7 e. Analytical specificity: Interference Study Protocol:  The sponsor evaluated the effect of the interfering substances using two patient serum pools with spiked digoxin at approximately 0.8 ng/mL and 2.8 ng/mL. For each substance, multiple aliquots of each pool were spiked with the test substance up to the maximum level shown below.  Samples were tested in duplicate and the results of the pools with interferent were compared to the pools without interferent, and % interference was calculated. Result Summary: Based on the sponsor-defined interference limit of ± 10%, the following claims were made: v The below compounds at the indicated concentration do not cause significant interference with the assay. Compound Concentration  up to Bilirubin (unconjugated) 27.4 mg/dL Bilirubin (conjugated) 22.2 mg/dL Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL Lipemia (Intralipid) 798 mg/dL Triglycerides 1000 mg/dL Cholesterol 500 mg/dL Gamma-globulin 5000 mg/dL Protein (total) 12000 mg/dL Protein (albumin) 6000 mg/dL Rheumatoid Factor 700 IU/mL Uric Acid 27.9 mg/dL Cross-Reactivity Study Protocol:  The sponsor evaluated cross-reactivity using two methods.  First, endogenous and non-structurally related compounds were tested in the presence of 1 ng/mL digoxin, and the levels ion cross-reactant tested were at or above the maximum physiological or pharmacological concentration.  A dilution series was prepared by dilution a serum pool containing a concentration of 1 ng/mL digoxin with the highest level of cross-reactant with the same pool without the cross-reactant (control), to yield five dilutions for testing each cross-reactant.  The second study was conducted to test structurally related substances.  The cross-reactants were evaluated in both digoxin-free serum and serum containing 2.34 ng/mL digoxin.  Each cross-reactant was assayed in duplicate with the corresponding control. Result Summary: Based on a sponsor-defined cross reactivity of >10% difference from control, none of the tested substances at the indicated concentrations below will significantly cross  8 react with the proposed assay.
